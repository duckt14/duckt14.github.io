    "text": "Sant’Agata - Fango Radio\nTaking inspiration from the experiments conducted by Cleve Backster, for this first “Short Concert for Houseplants” intitled Sant’Agata we worked on the construction of a system that allows a plant to play, for creating a sound representation of its emotional intelligence symbolically perceptible to us humans. The system that I constructed consists of an electrocardiogram sensor that monitors the potential action of the plant - the electrical signals due to the communication activity between cells, made possible by plasmodesmata, phloem and xylem - through electrodes placed on the leaves and along the stem of the vegetable. The data resulting from monitoring are processed, transformed and analyzed to produce sounds that demonstrate the behavior of the plant or to decide the pitch and duration of the sound to be played on a specific virtual instrument. Data analysis also allows you to establish the rhythm of the composition. For this first plant concert a sansevieria, a calathea and a tomato plant were involved.\nThe piece was made in collaboration with Eugenio Nicolella and Lorenzo Peluffo.\n\n\n\nEnrico Turletti · Sant'Agata.
