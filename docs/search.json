The system that I constructed consists of an electrocardiogram sensor that monitors the potential action of the plant - the electrical signals due to the communication activity between cells, made possible by plasmodesmata, phloem and xylem - through electrodes placed on the leaves and along the stem of the vegetable. The data resulting from monitoring are processed, transformed and analyzed to produce sounds that demonstrate the behavior of the plant or to decide the pitch and duration of the sound to be played on a specific virtual instrument. Data analysis also allows you to establish the rhythm of the composition. For this first plant concert a sansevieria, a calathea and a tomato plant were involved.\nThe piece was made in collaboration with Eugenio Nicolella and Lorenzo Peluffo.\n\n\n\nEnrico Turletti · Sant'Agata.

The work explores new scenarios and new forms of power in the field of biotechnology in which the machine is able to intervene on the genetic sequences of living beings in an automated manner. In the installation, artificial intelligence monitors both the environment in which the plant is placed and its state of health. By examining the data collected through the sensors, it generates new DNA sequences with which they replace the genes considered harmful to the plant. The two monitors on the sides of the alocasia show processes that cannot be observed with the naked eye. It is thus possible to view the vital parameters of the plant, the problems found within its organism and the solutions implemented by the machine to re-establish the ideal condition of immortality. A real-time generative soundscape based on the slow tropisms of the plant and the genetic codes produced by the machine describes the relationship between the organic and the inorganic."

    "text": "Holobiont\n\nWith Lorenzo Peluffo\n\nIperspazio, Milan, Italy.\n\n\n18 April - 27 April 2024\n\n\nIn his latest work entitled Novacene, James Lovelock imagines a future in which machines will be equipped with artificial intelligence that will surpass human intelligence, allowing them to control and safeguard life on Earth and the fate of the entire universe. What would happen if in the near future this scenario were realized through the automation of a CRISPR technique? What if the machine could constantly monitor the genetic description of a being, its interactions with the environment and its behaviors, with the ability to modify the DNA of the being in real time to improve it for the environmental conditions in which it finds itself? Holobiont investigates this scenario by proposing a speculative installation in which two entities are involved: an alocasia and a computer. Through the establishment of a symbiotic relationship, these two entities give life to a new organism based on their coexistence. Inside a laboratory illuminated by LED lamps for cultivation, the body of the alocasia is connected to electrodes and metal cables to be monitored through the use of body monitoring sensors and environmental monitoring sensors. The data produced by these devices are processed by algorithms and neural networks to recognize variations in the plant’s behavior and state of health. Inspired by the prototype of digital data storage in living cells through electrogenic writing with modulation of electrochemical signals created by the laboratory of Professor Harris H. Wang of Columbia University, the results produced by monitoring are used by the computer to determine genetic intervention via a CRISPR technique automated. The editing is in fact coordinated by an algorithm that traces sequences in the plant’s DNA that can be replaced with alternative genetic sequences that will improve its body. A background sound accompanies the installation space, interacting with the monitoring of the alocasia, the evolution of its genetic makeup and the activity carried out by the computer. In a historical context in which bodies are dismembered and dematerialized into information, goods for the market and fuel to pursue the ideal of incessant improvement, reappropriating the devices of power - in this case biotechnological and bioinformatics - means being able to imagine different models of society from what we find ourselves in today. Holobiont attempts to do so by placing himself in a liminal space between the reflection on the exercise of power and the alternative use of technology as a function of collaboration between different beings, to imagine a society less oriented towards humans and more intrinsically ecological."
