The system that I constructed consists of an electrocardiogram sensor that monitors the potential action of the plant - the electrical signals due to the communication activity between cells, made possible by plasmodesmata, phloem and xylem - through electrodes placed on the leaves and along the stem of the vegetable. The data resulting from monitoring are processed, transformed and analyzed to produce sounds that demonstrate the behavior of the plant or to decide the pitch and duration of the sound to be played on a specific virtual instrument. Data analysis also allows you to establish the rhythm of the composition. For this first plant concert a sansevieria, a calathea and a tomato plant were involved.\nThe piece was made in collaboration with Eugenio Nicolella and Lorenzo Peluffo.\n\n\n\nEnrico Turletti · Sant'Agata.

In August 2024, we recorded the sounds emitted by two red hens, Monica and Samantha, over ten consecutive nights using a portable recorder and a surveillance camera. The recordings were analyzed to identify the different types of sounds produced during sleep, tracing the sequence and tonal variations, with the aim of creating a ten-night diary. This process led to the development of an artificial intelligence capable of delivering a revelation each morning to the human living alongside the hens. This AI functions as a digital oracle: it processes the hens’ nighttime sounds and, like a modern-day dream interpreter, transforms their memory into a narrative of the future, shared with the human. The installation featured a book narrating the project and illustrating the ten-night diary, along with two monitors displaying footage from the surveillance camera and a visual representation of the artificial intelligence at work."

Through diagnostic sensors, AI monitors the plants’ health, capturing phytoelectrical and phytoneural activity to map behavioral patterns. Additional sensors collect data from the external environment, enabling the AI to analyze trends, predict developments, and even intervene if necessary. The plant’s responses, environmental dynamics, and AI analyses are shared with visitors as a real-time generative soundscape, accompanied by two monitors displaying the sound design process and a graphic produced with a genetic algorithm and cellular automaton—symbolizing the system’s evolution."

The computer monitors the room’s environment—tracking temperature, humidity, air pressure, light intensity, and air quality—while also gathering data from the plants in the garden. Through sensors placed on their leaves, the system reads the plants’ electrical pulses per minute and their phytoneural activity. Inside the computer, an artificial intelligence processes this data and transforms it into sound, which serves as the auditory backdrop of the installation."

The installation explores a potential future scenario where the organic and the inorganic collaborate. Artificial intelligence simulates an ultra-innovative genetic technique that aims to speculatively modify the plant’s DNA to make it immortal. The work explores new scenarios and new forms of power in the field of biotechnology in which the machine is able to intervene on the genetic sequences of living beings in an automated manner. In the installation, artificial intelligence monitors both the environment in which the plant is placed and its state of health. By examining the data collected through the sensors, it generates new DNA sequences with which they replace the genes considered harmful to the plant. The two monitors on the sides of the alocasia show processes that cannot be observed with the naked eye. It is thus possible to view the vital parameters of the plant, the problems found within its organism and the solutions implemented by the machine to re-establish the ideal condition of immortality. A real-time generative soundscape based on the slow tropisms of the plant and the genetic codes produced by the machine describes the relationship between the organic and the inorganic."

The data produced by these devices are analysed and processed by algorithms and neural networks to generate music in real time, establishing the timbres and structure of the composition based on the different behaviours observed. Holobiont presents a reflection on the inclusion of non-human beings within human society, a topic that raises questions about how we view and represent them within our institutions and organisations. By involving humans and non-humans within an artistic process such as music through the mediation of technology, Holobiont proposes an experience in which we can enjoy a way of living based on alliance and the altruistic rediscovery of relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEnrico Turletti · Symbiotic Concert - L'orto che cura, Collegno"
