  <h2>Gallus gallus. Diary of 10 Nights in August</h2>
  <h5>With Lorenzo Peluffo</h5>
  <h6>GhÃ«ddo, Superbudda, Turin, Italy</h6>
  <h6>23 October - 1 November 2024</h6>
  <h6>The book is part of the <a href='https://interspecieslibrary.com/'>Interspecies Library</a>, New York City, NY, USA</h6>
<br>
<p>The project unfolds as an experiment in speculative narrative, intertwining technology, bioacoustics, and futurology.<br>
In August 2024, we recorded the sounds emitted by two red hens, Monica and Samantha, over ten consecutive nights using a portable recorder and a surveillance camera. The recordings were analyzed to identify the different types of sounds produced during sleep, tracing the sequence and tonal variations, with the aim of creating a ten-night diary.<br>
This process led to the development of an artificial intelligence capable of delivering a revelation each morning to the human living alongside the hens. This AI functions as a digital oracle: it processes the hens' nighttime sounds and, like a modern-day dream interpreter, transforms their memory into a narrative of the future, shared with the human.<br>
The installation featured a book narrating the project and illustrating the ten-night diary, along with two monitors displaying footage from the surveillance camera and a visual representation of the artificial intelligence at work.</p>
