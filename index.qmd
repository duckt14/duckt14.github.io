<h2>KA//PA//RO</h2>
##### With Lorenzo Peluffo
###### Visions in Motion, <a class="link-to-ext" href='https://recontemporary.com/' class=>Recontemporary</a>, Cape Town, South Africa
###### 18 February - 23 February 2025
<br>
<p>KA//PA//RO is an audiovisual installation that narrates the encounter between a Juniperus phoenicea grown in Piedmont and the plants inhabiting the garden of the villa that hosted the exhibition.<br>
To envision how this encounter might have unfolded, we developed a program that simulated the event by creating a system composed of the corresponding virtual plants. As the program ran, we recorded the evolution of the system by monitoring the exchange of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)—a class of chemical compounds used by plants for communication.<br>
The resulting data is presented in both musical and visual forms:<br>
❧ Musically, through a soundscape incorporating electronic sounds, sonifications, and manipulated field recordings.<br>
❧ Visually, through graphic interfaces displaying the software simulation: one animated graph, where the system’s evolution is visible, and three other screens where the system is transformed into a sonic structure.<br>
This work is part of our ongoing research into interspecies thinking and speculative storytelling practices. Through this exploration, we develop new forms of collaboration and connection between different organisms, embracing their distinct perspectives by employing contemporary technological tools.</p>
