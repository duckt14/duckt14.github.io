Hi, I'm Enrico! Iâ€™m interested in ecological art and postmedia practices and I have a transdisciplinary approach that moves through posthuman philosophy, computer science, visual and sound.
My artistic research is focused on creating practices in which to strengthen the connections that bind us to the other beings with whom we inhabit the planet, involving them in our daily human activities. In all my practices, the connections between humans and other beings are mediated by technology: this represents for me a way to think about the constitution of our consciousness, knowledge, individuality and to go beyond the culture-nature dichotomy by creating spaces in which bonds between beings harmoniously gives life to a new entities resulting from their collaboration.
